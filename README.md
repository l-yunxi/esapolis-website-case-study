# esapolis-website-case-study

Esapolis is Italy’s first large insectarium and an interactive museum in Padua dedicated to insects and invertebrates. The museum is managed in collaboration between the Province of Padua and Butterfly Arc and hosts exhibitions, labs and educational activities for visitors of all ages.  
I independently designed and developed the public website of Esapolis as a web developer, also contributing to visual content creation.

- Integration of dynamic content (blog posts, events, educational initiatives) into the CMS.
- Creation and editing of photographic material for the website (museum spaces, exhibits, events) to ensure coherent visual storytelling.
- Writing and adapting part of the website content (texts for sections and pages) in collaboration with the museum team.
- UX refinements for navigation: clear information hierarchy, readable typography, internal links between sections.
